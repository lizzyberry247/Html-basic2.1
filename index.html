   Understanding Meal Planning
</h1>
    <section>
<p>
        To the uninitiated, meal planning can feel like an elusive practice or an overwhelming task,
        but that’s usually because we think about meal planning from the endpoint — 
        when all the recipes have been selected,  
        when all the groceries have been shopped for,
        Put all the information in front of a newbie and their eyes grow wide with one resounding question:
        But how do I do it?
    </ul>     
</p>
<p>
     <dl>What it is:</dl>
     <dd>Meal planning is  the what’s for dinner question <strong>once</strong> for the whole week,instead of every night
    and then shopping for and prepping the ingredients before cooking.</dd> 
    We believe the simplest way to approach meal planning is with three steps.
    <ol>
        <li>Select your dinners and their recipes, if needed.</li>
        <li>Shop for ingredients.</li> 
        <li>Prepare those ingredients</li>
    </ol>

        <em>
        “Every meal should end with something sweet. Maybe it’s jelly on
        toast at breakfast or a small piece of chocolate at dinner – but it
        always helps my brain bring a close to the meal.”</em> ~ Robert Irvine
